Super-Simple DirectMedia Layer.
===============================

Simplified wrapper around SDL meant for one-window projects
that just want a simple foreign function interface with the bare essentials.

SSDL removes many of the lower-level details in SDL.

* hides structures 
* hides enums
* removes callbacks

making the FFI (foreign function interface) much less complicated.
SSDL is extremely tiny and only has two dynamic library files: SSDL and version
2.0.4 of SDL.

Features:
* documentation!
* examples!
* exactly one window
* one audio device
* writing bytes (almost) directly to the audio buffer
* loading bitmaps, but masking magenta pixels out
* drawing textures
* rotating textures
* flipping textures horizontally/vertically
* modulating the color of textures
* alpha blending
* drawing rectangle outlines
* drawing filled rectangles
* keyboard input
* mouse input
* multiple joystick inputs

In fact, that's it. Everything else is up to you. Simple. Super-Simple. SS. 
Direct. Super Direct. Super-Simple Direct. media. Super Layer. Direct Layer.
Super-Simple media.

SSDL.
